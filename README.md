# Aztec Starter

## Sandbox

This repo is meant to be a starting point for learning to write Aztec contracts and tests on the Aztec sandbox (local development environment). It includes an example contract, useful commands in `package.json` and helfpul scripts in `./scripts`.

You can find the **Easy Private Voting contract** in `./src/main.nr`. A simple integration test is in `./src/test/e2e/index.test.ts`.

## Testnet

This repo connects to a locally running Aztec Sandbox by default, but can be configured to connect to the testnet by specifying `AZTEC_ENV=testnet` in a `.env` file or by prefixing a command e.g. `AZTEC_ENV=testnet yarn deploy`.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Use **Node.js version 22.15.0**.

[Start your codespace from the codespace dropdown](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).

Get the **sandbox, aztec-cli, and other tooling** with this command:

```bash
bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
```

Install the correct version of the toolkit with:

```bash
aztec-up 2.0.2
```

### Environment Configuration

This project uses JSON configuration files to manage environment-specific settings:

- `config/sandbox.json` - Configuration for local sandbox development
- `config/testnet.json` - Configuration for testnet deployment

The system automatically loads the appropriate configuration file based on the `ENV` environment variable. If `ENV` is not set, it defaults to `sandbox`.

The configuration files contain network URLs, timeouts, and environment-specific settings. You can modify these files to customize your development environment.

### Running on Sandbox (Local Development)

Start the sandbox with:

```bash
aztec start --sandbox
```

Run scripts and tests with default sandbox configuration:

```bash
yarn deploy       # Deploy to sandbox
yarn test         # Run tests on sandbox
```

### Running on Testnet

All scripts support a `::testnet` suffix to automatically use testnet configuration:

```bash
yarn deploy::testnet              # Deploy to testnet
yarn test::testnet                # Run tests on testnet
yarn deploy-account::testnet      # Deploy account to testnet
yarn interaction-existing-contract::testnet  # Interact with testnet contracts
```

The `::testnet` suffix automatically sets `ENV=testnet`, loading configuration from `config/testnet.json`.

---

## 📦 **Install Packages**

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## 🏗 **Compile**

```bash
aztec-nargo compile
```

or

```bash
yarn compile
```

---

## 🔧 **Codegen**

Generate the **contract artifact JSON** and TypeScript interface:

```bash
yarn codegen
```

---

:warning: Tests and scripts set up and run the Private Execution Environment (PXE) and store PXE data in the `./store` directory. If you restart the sandbox, you will need to delete the `./store` directory to avoid errors.

## Transaction Profiling

**Make sure the sandbox is running before profiling.**

```bash
aztec start --sandbox
```

Then run an example contract deployment profile with:

```bash
yarn profile
```

## 🧪 **Test**

**Make sure the sandbox is running before running tests.**

```bash
aztec start --sandbox
```

Then test with:

```bash
yarn test
```

Testing will run the **TypeScript tests** defined in `index.test.ts` inside `./src/test/e2e`, as well as the [Aztec Testing eXecution Environment (TXE)](https://docs.aztec.network/developers/guides/smart_contracts/testing) tests defined in [`first.nr`](./src/test/first.nr) (imported in the contract file with `mod test;`).

Note: The Typescript tests spawn an instance of the sandbox to test against, and close it once the TS tests are complete.

---

## Scripts

You can find a handful of scripts in the `./scripts` folder.

- `./scripts/deploy_account.ts` is an example of how to deploy a schnorr account.
- `./scripts/deploy_contract.ts` is an example of how to deploy a contract.
- `./scripts/fees.ts` is an example of how to pay for a contract deployment using various fee payment methods.
- `./scripts/multiple_pxe.ts` is an example of how to deploy a contract from one PXE instance and interact with it from another.
- `./scripts/profile_deploy.ts` shows how to profile a transaction and print the results.
- `./scripts/interaction_existing_contract.ts` demonstrates how to interact with an already deployed voting contract, including casting votes and checking vote counts.

### Utility Functions

The `./src/utils/` folder contains utility functions:

- `./src/utils/create_account_from_env.ts` provides functions to create Schnorr accounts from environment variables (SECRET, SIGNING_KEY, and SALT), useful for account management across different environments.
- `./src/utils/setup_pxe.ts` provides a function to set up and configure the Private Execution Environment (PXE) service with proper configuration based on the environment.
- `./src/utils/deploy_account.ts` provides a function to deploy Schnorr accounts to the network with sponsored fee payment, including key generation and deployment verification.
- `./config/config.ts` provides environment-aware configuration loading, automatically selecting the correct JSON config file based on the `ENV` variable.

## ❗ **Error Resolution**

:warning: Tests and scripts set up and run the Private Execution Environment (PXE) and store PXE data in the `./store` directory. If you restart the sandbox, you will need to delete the `./store` directory to avoid errors.

### 🔄 **Update Node.js and Noir Dependencies**

```bash
yarn update
```

### 🔄 **Update Contract**

Get the **contract code from the monorepo**. The script will look at the versions defined in `./Nargo.toml` and fetch that version of the code from the monorepo.

```bash
yarn update
```

You may need to update permissions with:

```bash
chmod +x .github/scripts/update_contract.sh
```
